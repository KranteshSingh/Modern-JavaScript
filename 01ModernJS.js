console.log(carPrice)
var carPrice = 2000000
// It must show error because carPrice is defined later but we have used it at the beginning.
// On console it is showing 'undefined' which is technically INCORRECT

// Basic javascript see these line of code as follows

// var carPrice
// console.log(carPrice)
// carPrice = 2000000
